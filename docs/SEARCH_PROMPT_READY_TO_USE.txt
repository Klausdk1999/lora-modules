   Need: Complete system implementations, field deployments, network performance, real-world validation

2. ESP32 + LoRa Deep Sleep Power Management
   Search: "ESP32" AND "LoRa" AND ("deep sleep" OR "power consumption" OR "battery life")
   Need: Measured power consumption, battery life validation, wake-up time, power optimization

3. LoRaWAN Power Consumption Studies
   Search: "LoRaWAN" AND "power consumption" AND ("measurement" OR "empirical" OR "validation")
   Need: Empirical measurements, battery life studies, power models, field test data

PRIORITY 2 - IMPORTANT GAPS:

4. LoRaWAN Network Performance (Environmental Monitoring)
   Search: "LoRaWAN" AND "environmental monitoring" AND ("performance" OR "range" OR "coverage")
   Need: Outdoor performance, range analysis, link quality, gateway placement

5. WSN for Water Monitoring
   Search: "wireless sensor network" AND "water monitoring" AND ("river" OR "hydrological")
   Need: System architectures, multi-sensor integration, data aggregation

6. LoRaWAN vs Other LPWAN
   Search: "LoRaWAN" AND ("NB-IoT" OR "Sigfox") AND "comparison"
   Need: Comparative studies, trade-offs, cost-benefit analysis

PRIORITY 3 - SUPPORTING:

7. ESP32 Low-Power Validation
   Search: "ESP32" AND "low power" AND ("validation" OR "measurement" OR "empirical")

8. Sensor Integration with LoRaWAN
   Search: ("ultrasonic sensor" OR "LiDAR sensor") AND "LoRaWAN" AND "integration"
